Ideas ------------------------
	Origin -------------------
		Ancients spread throughout the galaxy - the first civilization
		They couldn't settle as many planets as people can - low habitability, also didn't really care
		Created humans to 
	Galaxy -------------------
		Sectors are grouped as constellations - named by those from center that could see the whole constellation!
	Team ---------------------
		Starting characters are horrible with money - gambling addicts and always lose
			"bet on both sides always win" - "that only works at home (house always wins)"
			"roulette hasn't hit red recently. Time to make some spacebucks"
	Famous pirates -----------
		Powerful ships and pilots - high bounties and rare items for taking them down
			These are the elite equivalents for my game
			Some stay in a sector on their own but some roam the galaxy
			Sector will be more empty

	Federation
	Empire (Lower Empire)
	Avalon Kingdom
	Revolutionaries

Setting ----------------------
	First act ----------------
		Purpose:
			Introduce player to the world
				Tells player about unreachable and dark core of the galaxy
				Ring galaxy
			Gives motivation and story to characters
				The two agree that they want to reach the core someday
				Need to build up a better ship and some supplies before making that journey
			Setup smaller scale battles to provide familiarity with combat

		End:
			Capture pivotal station from the Federation
			E3 is discovered during after the battle when returning to base
			
		Notes:
			Working for government as a privateer
			Large scale war by two factions over the entire galaxy
			Most battles are pushing into enemy territory or capturing a station
		

	Second act ---------------
		Purpose:
			Add new information about the galaxy
				There's actually an entire empire in the core
				Shrouded by the "Great Barrier" which hides away the center of the galaxy using the power of the core itself
				Filled with wealth and luxury due to the significantly higher quality resources
					Contains the true habitable zone : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_habitable_zone
			Introduces more cast members
				During / after a battle they meet a revolutionary from the Upper Empire who survived exile and needs to make it back
				The trio now need a better ship and a full crew more than ever
				Plan to travel into the high empire by entering a government defended special warp gate

		End:
			Team of P1-4 defeat a solo gateway guard to make their way into the Upper Empire

		Notes:
			Revolutionary was exiled after being found out, but was able to escape the death of exile with smuggled supplies and fuel
			Promises of riches and seeing the core sway the main team before a shaky alliance begins
			Plan is to make it into the Upper Empire and find a way to destroy the Great Barrier
	

	Third act ----------------
		Purpose:
			Introduce the Upper Empire territory
				Still has some areas of crime and rogue ships
				Government is hoarding energy crystals, and recently the rates have gone up significantly
					Revolution has been brewing and they plan to bring down the wall to foster attacks from the outside
					Not enough troops within the area, needs people from the outside
					Can't 
			Overthrow the Upper Empire
				Revolutionaries cook up a plan to hack into a core power crystal to overcharge the Great Barrier and cause it to fail
				The power crystals are unreachable by anyone but a small handful of government sanctioned engineers
					Without remote access, the revolutionaries need to be on site to deploy the virus
				Opening the wall will allow for a full scale revolution
				... and will divide the upper empire army
		End:
			Climactic battle at one of the core power crystals where the government sends forces to try to stop the virus
			The plan succeeds and the Great Barrier fails catastrophically, exploding into fragments next to the overcharged area


	Fourth act ---------------

			Discover reason for missing energy crystals

				... to some location to be used
			Locate pathway to the core
